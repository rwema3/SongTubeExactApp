## Contribute

You can contribute on anything you want from new features fixes, etc... But most importantly if the app doesn't support
your native Language you can contribute by implementing it! It's really easy:

**1st Step:** Create a new Language File by creating it under this project's **internal/languages** folder, the file needs to be named: "language**Code**.dart" (**Code** is the LanguageCode of the Language you are implementing, for example: **En** or **Es**), you can then copy the contents of any other already supported Language and adapt/translate it to your new one (Remember to change the class name to "Language**Code**").

**2nd Step:** To finish your implementation, open this file: [languages.dart](https://github.com/SongTube/SongTube-App/blob/master/lib/internal/languages.dart)

Inside that file you will find at the first code lines:

```dart
final _supportedLanguages = <LanguageData>[
  // English (US)
  LanguageData("ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸", "English", 'en'),
  // Spanish (VE)
  LanguageData("ve", "EspaÃ±ol", "es"),
];
Future<Languages> _loadLocale(Locale locale) async {
  switch (locale.languageCode) {
    // English (US)
    case 'en':
      return LanguageEn();
    // Spanish (VE)
    case 'es':
      return LanguageEs();
    // Default Language (English)
    default:
      return LanguageEn();
  }
}
```

Where for your new Language you have to add a new LanguageData(flag, name, languageCode) into the **_supportedLanguages** list, then, a new switch case in **_loadLocale()** function with your languageCode and return your new language File, open a Pull Request and after checking I will merge it!.

*If you don't feel like doing this last step, you can still send me your new Language File via PullRequest and I will do it.*
